# CDEvents Plugin version

The CDEvents plugin is versioned as follows:

`${revision}-${changelist}`

Where `revision` is incremented to match the spec of the current CDEvents SDK, and `changelist` is automatically
generated for each release.

In short, increments to `revision` should reflect (potentially breaking) changes to the CDEvents SDK or CDEvents spec,
while increments to `changelist` should reflect (non-breaking) changes to the CDEvents plugin itself.
